MINIBOT CODE INSTRUCTIONS

These are the blocks of code you need if the team uses C++

*****//Minibot realse
	if(opJoy->GetRawButton(9))MiniGo->Set(0.0);//servo all the way in
	if(opJoy->GetRawButton(4))MiniGo->Set(0.95);//servo all the way out
	if(opJoy->GetRawButton(10))MiniGo->Set(0.28);//servo in between (not halfway)*****

This code should be in the teleop section of the code or wherever they do their coding for teleop

******//Minibot Intialization- put this in "teleopinit" and "autonomousinit" (just to be safe) This makes sure that the servo is set in home and won't move the minibot/pin
	MiniGo->Set(0.0);//servo all the way in**********

You also have to define your objects. The team will probably have a joystick already defined, and you will have to substitute that with "opJoy" and put in the buttons that they would like to use

You need to create the MiniGo object. This will vary with team to team but this is the block of code you need
******Servo * MiniGo;*****

Next define the object as a new server in a PWM port
*****MiniGo = new Servo(10);****

Everything should hopefully work now!! :D Look at the C++ Reference guide and the Getting started with C++ if you need extra help
